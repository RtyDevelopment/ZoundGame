ZoundGame
=========

ZoundGame is an original game, developed by Rty Development, the International Soundlings Initiative and other members of the project. It was originally written to be played at the Center for Art and Culture (Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur) in Zoetermeer, the Netherlands. 

Later on a version to be played at home has been added. Currently the project is actively under development at Rty Development, led by Jasper Weyne.
